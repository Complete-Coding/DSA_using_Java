/**
 * Given an integer array nums, return the number of
 * elements that have both a strictly smaller and
 * a strictly greater element appear in nums.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [11,7,2,15]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The element 7 has the element 2 strictly
 * smaller than it and the element 11 strictly greater than it.
 * Element 11 has element 7 strictly smaller than it
 * and element 15 strictly greater than it.
 * In total there are 2 elements having both a strictly
 * smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [-3,3,3,90]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The element 3 has the element -3
 * strictly smaller than it and the element 90
 * strictly greater than it.
 * Since there are two elements with the value 3,
 * in total there are 2 elements having both a strictly
 * smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums.
 *
 * [1,1,1,2,2,3,4,5,5]
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 100
 * -105 <= nums[i] <= 105
