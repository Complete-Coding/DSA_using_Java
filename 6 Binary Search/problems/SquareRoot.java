/**
 * Given a non-negative integer x, compute and
 * return the square root of x.
 *
 * Since the return type is an integer, the
 * decimal digits are truncated, and only the
 * integer part of the result is returned.
 *
 * Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in
 * exponent function or operator, such as
 * pow(x, 0.5) or x ** 0.5.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: x = 4
 * Output: 2
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: x = 8
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842...,
 * and since the decimal part is truncated,
 * 2 is returned.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 0 <= x <= 231 - 1
